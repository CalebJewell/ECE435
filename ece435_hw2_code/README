Answers to Question 2:
	a)
	i. 404 - The server cannot find the the resource
	ii. The server attempts to brew coffee with a teapot.... funny haha
	iii. Unavailable because of legal reasons (censorship as an example) 

	b) 
	i. The maine.edu website is running a nginx server which is a free, high performance webserver (I have this on my pi too)
	ii. No because telnet is no longer a text based protocol so it will not connect to HTTP/2. If I run GET / HTTP/2 I get a 505 Http version not supported.
